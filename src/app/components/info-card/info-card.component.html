    <p>
      Sung Jin-Woo, dubbed the weakest hunter of all mankind, grows stronger by
      the day with the supernatural powers he has gained. However, keeping his
      skills hidden becomes more difficult as dungeon-related incidents pile up
      around him. When Jin-Woo and a few other low-ranked hunters are the
      only survivors of a dungeon that turns out to be a bigger challenge than
      initially expected, he draws attention once again, and hunter guilds take
      an increased interest in him. Meanwhile, a strange hunter who has been
      lost for ten years returns with a dire warning about an upcoming
      catastrophic event. As the calamity looms closer, Jin-Woo must continue
      leveling up to make sure nothing stops him from reaching his ultimate
      goal—saving the life of his mother.
