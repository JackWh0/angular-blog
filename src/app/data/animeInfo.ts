    'Sung Jin-Woo, dubbed the weakest hunter of all mankind, grows stronger by the day with the supernatural powers he has gained. However, keeping his skills hidden becomes more difficult as dungeon-related incidents pile up around him. When Jin-Woo and a few other low-ranked hunters are the only survivors of a dungeon that turns out to be a bigger challenge than initially expected, he draws attention once again, and hunter guilds take an increased interest in him. Meanwhile, a strange hunter who has been lost for ten years returns with a dire warning about an upcoming catastrophic event. As the calamity looms closer, Jin-Woo must continue leveling up to make sure nothing stops him from reaching his ultimate goal—saving the life of his mother. [Written by MAL Rewrite]',

        'No amount of memes or social media posts could ever make me hate Solo Leveling. No, Solo Leveling doesn’t have the strongest story, yes Jinwoo aura farms every episode and beats the bad guy, yes A-1 and Sawano help take this series to new heights, but is it a crime to just enjoy shows for the spectacle? At the end of the day, anime is about entertainment and pushing the envelope of the animation medium, which solo leveling does. Not everything needs to reinvent the wheel, it’s sort of like expecting every meal you eat to be a Michelin star restaurant. It’s ok to enjoya fast food meal every now and again if you just view and accept it as such. That’s basically how I feel about Solo Leveling. It’s not the best anime ever, but it is very enjoyable and unlike many people, I actually enjoy the story, characters and premise. Season 2 was only an upgrade in every way for me and is a must watch for any action or sakuga fan.\n\nWhile I don’t think Solo Leveling’s story is the best, I have to say I’m in the minority of people who actually think it’s kind of good? Sure, it’s slow to play out, but there’s been a clear goal in this series from day 1, curing Jinwoo’s mother and not so subtle hints about the magic beast gates/raids being more than they seem. Season 2 builds on this by clearly setting up some greater power that’s pitting humanity against the magic beasts. For what reason? We don’t know, it’s a slow build up, but I completely disagree with the logic that “Solo leveling has no story” I really enjoy the mystery and speculating every week about what’s going on in the world. If you’re looking for something extremely complex then yea, Solo leveling isn’t going to knock your socks off, it’s unashamedly a power fantasy, but if you go in with an open mind and actually analyze it in good faith I think many people will agree that there’s a decent amount of intrigue here.\n\nMy one real complaint with Solo leveling is that Jinwoo feels so one dimensional. It’s like he actually regressed as a person, but improved as a hunter since he got his abilities. Sometimes it feels like watching a cardboard cutout rather than a person. That’s just me speaking as an anime only who’s only got these two seasons to go off of though. I assume he’s going to actually change as the story goes on and new threats emerge, but damn he just feels so edgy in this season. This isn’t entirely out of place given the stuff he’s been through in the past, his family situation, etc., but I would like to see a little more personality!\n\nGoes without saying A-1 and Sawano delivered yet another masterclass this season. I think the OST is even better, the OP with my goat Felix from stray kidz and LiSA has been on repeat nonstop since it dropped. The fights in this season surpass the first and the art is very good as usual. The production quality is amazing, it’s one of the best looking anime out there and it just reaffirms my belief that A-1 pictures at their best are as good as anyone in this industry. SAO Alicization, 86 and now Solo Leveling have shown that they have arrived and are here to stay. So many times during this season I just found my jaw on the floor with how great the choreography and storyboarding looked. Bravo.\n\nIf you step back and simply consider Solo Leveling as an easily digestible feast on the eyes with a simple, but interesting plot, you’ll enjoy this. If you come into it trying to be an anime critic and nitpick every aspect of the series, you’ll be miserable. There’s a reason why it’s one of the most popular manhwa ever. \n\nSolo leveling season 2 gets 9 out of 10',

        "Watching this show felt like sitting through a series of Let’s Play videos on Youtube: a meaningless waste of time but somewhat entertaining. If you replaced Jinwoo in this show with Rudeus from Mushoku Tensei, all the people screeching about how good this show is would go run and hide back in their basement. You'd ruin both shows at the same time. Replacing the core of Mushoku character development and storytelling with a bland nobody with zero personality at the same time replacing the core of Solo Leveling's power fantasy since nobody wants to go around fantasizing about being a pedophile. This is the new brandof isekai where instead of fantasizing about killing yourself/getting run over by a truck and reincarnating in a brand new world, OP with no problems to trouble you, now you fantasize about going into a 'dungeon' and coming out OP af with special treatment from god himself and nobody can ever reach your heights except you.\n\nYou can never get genuinely invested in anything Jinwoo does because the outcome is always the same old predictable, boring smut-fest. There are no stakes in a show where the only possible outcomes for a fight are win or lose because Jinwoo is always going to win. \n\nThere are no characters in this show besides Jinwoo and so there’s nothing for us to latch onto besides his trials and tribulations which frankly shouldn't even be classified as such. This show treats side characters as disposable props rather than fleshed-out individuals with a not so subtle dig at their “no potential for growth” status contrasting Jinwoo’s. Characters exist solely to highlight Jinwoo’s superiority or to be rescued, stripped of their agency. Female characters feel especially lackluster as they exist purely to be cheerleaders for Jinwoo’s power trips and validate him, regressing sexist tropes back another 100 years.\n\nThe animation is superb as is the case for most of A-1 Pictures’ works. They’re a fantastic animation studio.\n\nVillains are the lifeblood of a show and they make or break shows for me. There are no villains here, except mindless monsters and one-dimensional ‘bad’ guys. So bad.\n\nThe glaringly obvious rip-off of Hunter x Hunter is disgusting. The author basically wrote fanfiction for what if the Chimera Ant arc had Superman appear out of nowhere and solve all of our problems for us. \nOMG wHaTaGrEaTiDeA\n\nRemember when all the critics complained that Demon Slayer was nothing but a simple story with flashy animation? That series somehow still had 750 times more character and structure than this.\n\nIf you stripped away all of the slick animation, you’d be left with a PowerPoint presentation titled, “Why I’m Cool:” By Sung Jinwoo.",

        "I'm relatively new to the anime fandom, only having watched 20 or so animes. Till now, there hasn't been one anime where I thought it was actually horrendous. This is the first show I've rated less than a five. This show does so many things wrong I actually cannot comprehend how it's sitting at a 8.88. Story? bland. Characters? non-existent. Themes? unexplored. Entertaining? uh, sometimes I guess. This season was uninteresting and bland all the way through. In my opinion, this show did nothing right, fights had no substance, the characters are even real characters, only exisiting to glaze Jin-woo. His loss of humanity is a halfassedplotline and not really that engaging or interesting since they don't really explore it.\n\nThe writing was not only bad, but also insanely repetitive. Jin-woo fights boss -&gt; \"arise\" with nothing interesting to latch onto. No real emotion, themes or anything. Even visually, it's all the same.  These villains have zero personality and only serve as a villain of the week type thing.\n\nThis show can't even make up for all of its flaws with comedy or animation. Because while I think the animation is good, it's not that groundbreaking. This show also just takes itself way too seriously for what it is. \n\nLike, I understand that people watch this only for the fights and aura, but the only other pure battle shounen I've watched, Jujutsu Kaisen, does everything this show does, but better in literally every single way you can think of. Better characters, better fights, better themes, better comedy, more substance, more entertaining and the list just goes on.\n\nPower fantasies shouldn't be excused for having horrible characters and story. You can focus on battles and aura while being, funny and intersting.\n\nThis is the most nothingburger anime I've seen.",

        "“Y’all got any good writing?” “We got hype moments and aura.” Season 2 of Solo Leveling is more of the same; more irritating pseudo-chuuni sophistry, more interchangeable sakuga-interested fight scenes designed to be reposted rather than enjoyed, more characters with increasingly similar names we have to pretend care about, procedurally generated “TOP TEN COOLEST ANIME ENTRANCES”-ass entertainment wrapped in a layer of undeserved pretension. Clearly something’s working, though, because this is currently the twenty-fifth highest rated show on here and one of the most viewed series ever on Crunchyroll. Streaming sites crash whenever a new episode comes out. I’ve seen more people talk about Solo Leveling inthe past three months than the most recent MCU flop. I’ll give the show credit and say it looks appealing, because I’m not deliberately obtuse enough to pretend the flash over substance angle isn’t exactly what thrives in this modern viewing environment where everything has to be as concise as possible. But flash over substance implies the existence of any kind of substance at all. It’s just under 300 chapters worth of Timmy’s middle school Wattpad ego trip about beating up the mean kids at school after getting bullied for the last time, Tails Gets Trolled if the ironic self-awareness was feigned. This is not the kind of work that deserves a full-scale anime production, but you can chalk it up to corporate suits who keep throwing money at D-grade internet fanfiction until it becomes the “next big thing”. You wouldn’t be reading this if not for them, because Solo Leveling as a concept wouldn’t have advanced past the dumpster of the online serialization where it belongs.\n\nThe characters are still one-note and unlikeable. I don’t even know what Sung Jinwoo’s goal is anymore. The impetus for his transformation into an emotionless RPG slave is resolved by the halfway point of the season when he wakes his comatose mother. The moment where he heals ger is the single best moment in the entire show, because as SJW cries tears of relief, he begins to feel like a real person, someone you can sympathize with and relate to, if only for a minute (elevated to tearjerker levels by Taito Ban’s vocal performance); it comes as no surprise that this is the most disliked episode of the season. Apparently having the self-insert main character show any sort of convincing human emotion signifies that he “lost his aura”, because the only thing that matters now is how an anime presents itself and not what it stands for or how it conveys ideas. I’m not sure why people prefer that Jinwoo be an emotionless Gary Stu so badly like it’s a good thing if a character never feels or reacts to anything going on around them. Make him cry more! Even a smile or two would be enough! I can’t believe I’m defending fucking Solo Leveling – from its own fanbase no less – but the moment the show threatens to become watchable, they all seem to turn on it.\n\nThe story seems to bend over backwards to make SJW the strongest and most competent character in any given situation, which makes for an exhausting watch experience. His biggest trial this season is getting grazed by one of the bosses he’s fighting. He either defeats every single enemy without breaking a sweat or he lets his shadows do all the work for him. I couldn’t take any aspect of the narrative seriously after Jinwoo easily killed a supposedly unbeatable monster as everyone looked on in shock for tenth time in the span of five episodes. The only other times Jinwoo shows any appeal is when he foregoes his job as an S-rank monster hunter to hang out with his mom and sister to compensate for all the years of bonding his family didn’t get to experience and then go stand around on the roof of his apartment. Yet this somehow manages to undercut Jinwoo’s appeal even more as it takes place during a battle that involves several innocent people dying horribly, which could’ve been prevented had he been there. There’s layers to Solo Leveling’s incompetence – even when it’s doing something right it’s at the cost of something else like some kind of narrative equivalent exchange. RDCworld did a pretty funny video about it.\n\nPut a gun to my head and ask me to name five Solo Leveling characters and what their personalities are beyond surface-level archetypal traits. It’s impossible. Anyone who isn’t Sung Jinwoo barely services the overall narrative and I’m convinced that if you removed 75% of the supporting cast this show would be at least five episodes shorter. This season alone introduces like fifty equally terrible new hunters, monsters and civilians who all have the memorability and personality of a rock. You already know none of these unlikeable, incompetent, superficial dipshits aren’t going to matter by the end of the season because Jinwoo does all the heavy lifting for everyone else while they stand around verbally fellating him. This season even brings in a staggeringly uninteresting future love interest whose loyalty towards SJW is only justified by the fact that she thinks he smells better than everyone else – I actually paused the episode here and had to go watch an entire episode of Medalist just to get my mind off how embarrassing it was that a grown adult could write something so insipid. The only good character in this season is Esil, a demon girl who shows up as a sidekick for one episode and she is the cutest goshdarn thing I’ve ever seen. I can’t complain about her minimal presence because she’d probably be ruined if she stayed around any longer than that.\n\nThe other S-Rank hunters are just as useless as they were in the manhwa. There’s this annoying nerd who looks like if Aizen was drawn by a fujoshi, some guy who turns into a werewolf, a really big dude with an afro, all of whom exist to stand around either monologuing, killing fodder enemies, or getting fodderized by the actual threats so Jinwoo can come save them – but only after standing around and letting a few of them die so he can look cool, of course. The Japanese hunters have it even worse; this is a Korean franchise after all, so anyone who represents a foreign nation is either a weaselly little bastard with no sense of honor or the most pathetic jobber on the face of the earth. And you’d better believe Solo Leveling will cut away from the fights multiple times per episode in service of another scene where these dweebs stand around in an office to deliver exposition as if they haven’t wasted enough time doing that already. The show’s pacing is dreadful to the point it keeps bringing back old plot points and then not resolving them until a later arc. Remember Wang Dong Suck’s brother who vowed to avenge his death in season 1? He gets offscreened by Jinwoo’s dad and his plotline gets dropped until the next season, where he’ll inevitably get folded again because nobody in Solo Leveling gets to do anything other than job unless they’re Sung Jinwoo.\n\nThis show isn’t just derivative, it blatantly lifts storylines from series I would rather be enjoying instead. The major focus of this season aside from the endless meandering and dropped subplots is a shameless rehash of the Chimera Ant arc from Hunter x Hunter, which suffers the most from the show’s terrible pacing; despite being the selling point of season 2, it gets condensed down to three episodes which is indicative of the season’s detrimentally rapid pacing. Instead of a complex and nuanced antagonist like Meruem, the character he was derived from, Beru is just another obstacle for Jinwoo to curbstomp. SJW could be fighting some fodder enemy for all I care, because there’s no tangible conflict here like there was in HxH. I think this perfectly summarizes everything wrong with Solo Leveling; it copies better works at a surface level and retains none of the underlying themes and exchange of viewpoints that make them what they are. I mean for God's sake there’s a scene halfway through the season where Jinwoo has a flashback of his mom getting burnt to save him and it’s lifted shot for shot, word for word from one of Shinichi’s flashbacks in Parasyte. I’m not sure how Chugong even got away with this, because it’s not exactly subtle.\n\nWhen I was reviewing the first season, I noted that the technical competence was one of the few saving graces of the show, but now it feels like A-1 Pictures started experiencing budget cuts midway through the production. Season 1 wasn’t coming close to Dubu’s art from the manhwa, but it wasn’t constantly flipping between rejected character drawings from One-Punch Man season 2. I actually went back and compared episodes to their respective chapters, and it wasn’t even a contest between the two mediums. I can say with confidence the anime looks like a Deviantart user trying to recreate their favorite anime screencap in comparison, especially now that the overwhelming amount of off-model character art can be spotted without having to pause mid-scene like in the first season. The professionally constructed paneling and framing of certain events in the manhwa was woefully underutilized a lot of the time this season, if not outright butchered for seemingly no reason; there’s a moderately iconic panel where a villain rips off a character’s arms and walks away towards the viewer in the next panel with their opponent bleeding profusely in the background. I was baffled that such a clear-cut panel to adapt wasn’t included; rather, the director opted to show it at a different, less striking angle that made what could’ve been an effective moment of intimidation look boring in comparison. Little things like that make me wonder what the fuck is going on at A-1 Pictures and if they have any quality control in their studio.\n\nI already mentioned last season how unmemorable and samey Hiroyuki Sawano’s score for this series felt to me, but it doesn’t even sound like him now. The opening is the best sounding track of the show so far and I’m not even sure if Sawano composed it or it’s another artist trying to imitate his style. It depresses hearing such a legendary composer phone it in to this extent. Even the fight choreography feels lazier than before. The twelfth episode is painfully inconsistent in terms of consistent animation fluidity, bad anatomy and lazily rendered CGI environments, which is made even more insulting by the fact that there are some genuinely great shots when the incomprehensible direction isn’t drowning everything else; stuff during the fight like the bug’s claw hovering inches away from Jinwoo’s eye, or Jinwoo staring down his reflection on a wall of ice are visually phenomenal. It's clear the storyboarders are trying during major sequences, are their efforts are commendable. Contrarily, the final battle between SJW and Beru has them do that thing from One Piece where they turn into brightly colored streaks and fly around in midair interspersed with that nauseating faux-shakycam thing anime directors do now. I had a hard time keeping track of what was going on at certain points because the camera was moving so fast it felt like I was watching on 2x speed, or even worse, watching a fight scene from Magia Record. The final attack is portrayed by a bunch of looping frames and a lazy panning shot complete with speed lines. I’m not sure why this episode was so highly praised considering how glaringly obvious the flaws were, so I have to assume most viewers were probably too disoriented from the fight scene to notice. \n\nGiving this season a 1/10 would be dishonest because compared to the first, the positive aspects were more abundant. Unlike the previous season, there were moments that felt like they made me see what fans see in this show.Episode eight looks fantastic aside from being a genuinely enjoyable experience compared to the rest of the show, mostly in part to Yoshihiro Kanno’s storyboards. Jinwoo punches a demon in the face so hard it creates a nuclear explosion. I liked that one moment significantly more than anything else that happened this season. And as previously mentioned, episode twelve has fantastic storyboarding at times in contrast to the overcomplicated scene direction. I rarely have anything good to say about this anime, because when there are positives they hardly last more than a few minutes and make you wish you were watching something else.",

        "I actually liked solo leveling S1 from the perspective of someone who never read the manhwa. At the time, I didn’t have many complaints. But now, here we are in S2. It’s not like this season is bad when it comes to delivering an experience. The action is still top tier, but that’s already a given for this series so I won’t go into detail praising it. Honestly I don’t even know how else people could praise it aside from the action, animation, art style and music? The same goes for its flaws, how else could people criticize it besides calling it simple and generic?Personally i never had major issues with the story. Like I said I enjoyed s1 even though it didn’t bring anything new to the table. It’s a very beginner friendly anime and even for veteran anime fans, not everything has to be complex or groundbreaking. So what else does this season offer? It keeps things straightforward, dungeon expeditions, key power ups and major battles that deliver that solo leveling excitement.\n\nHowever, if you’re a decent anime watcher, not even a full on veteran, just someone with around 300+ anime entries like me, you’re bound to experience a lot of déjà vu. My mind kept screaming, \"Bruh am I rewatching an anime I’ve already seen?\" This feeling built up to the point where it became mentally exhausting, especially during the Jeju Island part. It felt like I was watching one of my favorite arcs from another anime being ripped off. It left me with this emotional void fighting a monster I would already seen before just in a different form.  \n\nJinwoo’s character also feels much less likable this season. He comes off as edgy with little to no personality compared to s1, except for ep 9 and the finale, but even then, it still feels empty. Most fights lacked tension and when there was tension it often felt artificial.  \n\nOn a side note unrelated to SL, I find it funny that some of my friends won’t watch stuff like wind breaker (the delinquent anime) just because it only offers a good amount of fight choreography but lacks a strong story. Yet they’ll watch solo leveling any day even though the same logic applies. What more does this series have to offer?(The difference is that one is non-fantasy). I guess people will always prefer to hype fantasy action, no matter how generic the story is just like solo leveling and demon slayer. But no matter how successful these types of anime get they’ll always face criticism for their simplicity.  \n\nIf you’re wondering why I felt that way watching this season, it’s because H×H and SL's Ant Arc but i won’t go into detail since it's a spoiler free review i guess. I wasn’t sure how to put into words what I was feeling while watching the latter half of the series. Something about it triggered a strange, almost panicked reaction in me. At first, I couldn’t figure out why, but after thinking it over, I ended up writing this review in the mixed 'feelings' section just to get that feeling out of my system. Just a warning though, you probably couldn’t relate.\n\nIs this anime worth watching? Yes, if you’re just looking for cool MC moments, back to back. It has this vibe where you can almost feel like you’re the MC yourself, owning that protagonist energy (just me trying to look at it from an action lover’s perspective lol). But it might be a bit hit or miss if you're more competitive when it comes to watching things and want an emotional or meaningful payoff.\n\nOverall, 10/10 production quality from A-1 Pictures, but solo leveling s2 itself? I'd rate it between 6 and 7 out of 10. \nHopefully this review doesn’t come across as discouraging anyone from watching Solo Leveling. I’m just sharing my personal thoughts about it, and it’s actually my first time reviewing something too.",

        "Is Solo Leveling a good show? Meh. Is Solo Leveling a great show? No. Is Solo Leveling an okay show? Yes. There is absolutely nothing about this show that is special in any way. An 8.85 (currently) MAL rating is crazy. I'm not trying to be a hater, but I'm just being honest, there is nothing of sustenance here. The Plot - Terrible, might as well be nonexistent. You don't care about the plot at all with one exception when the protagonist completes a long-time goal. The Characters - Terrible. The only character that is even mediocre is the protagonist himself. He's cool. That's all he has,he's cool. Does a viewer care about him? No. Does he have an interesting personality? No. Does he have anything going for him outside of edgy coolness? No. And that's the best character in the show. Everybody else is pure garbage. You got waifu bait for weebs, who will latch on to any fictional 2d girl. But no girl in this show truly stands out, nor do they get any moment to shine. This show has a truly bland cast\n\nThe Artstyle - Average good anime. Nothing more to say. Nothing special at all\n\nThe Animation - Controversial opinion, but basically, all modern-day action animes have bad animation for the most part. This one is no exception. It uses that same garbage way of animating fights that JJK S1 and the Naruto vs Pain fight do. But those shows do it way better. At least in those shows, you can still see what's going on. In this show, the camera moves so damn much, you can't even see the freaking fight. I think the animation is bad, not on a technical level, but the animation-style is bad. Making the camera shake and having flashing bright light explosions all the time does not equal good animation. \n\nOverall - Solo Leveling S2 is a completely forgettable show completely unworthy of the hype it gets. S1 had an interesting beginning, and the protagonist still had something of a personality. This doesn't have that; it has one redeeming scene, and that's it. The show is bland, and I don't believe that's subjective opinion but objective fact. It does nothing special, and will be forgotten eventually. 10, 20, 30 years from now, no one will be talking about this show. And yet the shows that will still be talked about (which are way better by the way) such as Neon Genesis Evangelion, Dragon Ball Z, Naruto, etc somehow have lower ratings. \nIt doesn't make any sense. Someway somehow, aliens enactacted mind-control on most anime fans to convince them that this mediocre show is somehow excellent.",

        "Solo levelling might be the best piece of media ever crafted. At first i wasnt too into it because the mc looked like a wimp who even i could beat in a fistfight, but the end of season 1 is where my mind changed. He's cool and strong, can fight whatever he sets his mind to, and he's nonchalant about it too!! While watching season 2 i realized something, i found the mc attractive and by the end of it i fully realized i was gay all thanks to Sung Jin Woo... Solo levelling changed my life and i can't express how much it means to me Strong reccomend toanyone!",
